    "brief": "Whilst completing my degree I developed a keen interest in mathematics, programming and robotics and became fascinated by how they form a common connection between humans and the surrounding world. I am now pursuing a PhD investigating methods for learning both data efficiently and safely onboard physical robotic systems. I am particularly interested in using probabilistic models for learning dynamics models and their integration into model-based reinforcement learning algorithms."
